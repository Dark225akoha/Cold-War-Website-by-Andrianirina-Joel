                    Nothing is permanent, especially friendship. And guess who went from besties to enemies ? The USSR

                    I won't be biased in these articles, but brace yourself as the story is quite a mess.<br />

                    Oh surprise, the year is 1953 and one dude kicked the bucket. Joseph Stalin became past tense. With
                    bro’s death, his successor, Nikita Khrushchev, was about to turn things uglier with Kennedy, missiles and
                    Fidel Castro (pictured here), but why can’t they all be friends?<br />

                    The USSR were not inactive while the US was fighting in Vietnam. They went into Afghanistan,
                    invading the country to install their own puppet government but like a reverse Vietnam, they got
                    clapped by fierce resistance as the US was laughing in the back.
